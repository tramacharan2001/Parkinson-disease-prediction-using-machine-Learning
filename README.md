# Parkinson-disease-prediction-using-machine-learning
In this project I was trying to predict if a person will get Parkinson disease or not by using two algorithms Decision Tree and Random forest regressor

Parkinsonâ€™s Disease:
A disorder of the central nervous system that affects movement, often including tremors. Nerve cell damage in the brain causes dopamine levels to drop, leading to the symptoms of Parkinson's. Parkinson's often starts with a tremor in one hand. Other symptoms are slow movement, stiffness and loss of balance.
We predict if a person is effect by Parkinson or not by using gait dataset.

Gait Dataset
Dataset A (former NLPR Gait Database) was created on Dec. 10, 2001, including 20 persons. Each person has 12 image sequences, 4 sequences for each of the three directions,

Symptoms
Tremor: can occur at rest, in the hands, limbs, or can be postural
Muscular: stiff muscles, difficulty standing, difficulty walking, difficulty with bodily movements, involuntary movements, muscle rigidity, problems with coordination, rhythmic muscle contractions, slow bodily movement, or slow shuffling gait
Sleep: early awakening, nightmares, restless sleep, or sleep disturbances
Whole body: fatigue, dizziness, poor balance, or restlessness
Cognitive: amnesia, confusion in the evening hours, dementia, or difficulty thinking and understanding
Speech: difficulty speaking, soft speech, or voice box spasms
Nasal: distorted sense of smell or loss of smell
Urinary: dribbling of urine or leaking of urine
Mood: anxiety or apathy
Facial: jaw stiffness or reduced facial expression
Also common: blank stare, constipation, depression, difficulty swallowing, drooling, falling, fear of falling, loss in contrast sensitivity, neck tightness, small handwriting, trembling, unintentional writhing, or weight loss

Treatments
Medications like-Dopamine promoter, Antidepressant, Cognition-enhancing medication and Anti-Tremor

AIM OF THE PROJECT:
The aim of the project is to predict whether a person will get Parkinson disease or not.

SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
1.Python
2.Jupyter Notebook

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
The hardware requirements that map towards the software are as follows: 
RAM               8GB
System type:    64-bit operating system, x64-based processor.
